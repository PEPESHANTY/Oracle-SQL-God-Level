Physical Aspect of Oracle Database:
As per DBA a Database is collection of some data files and log files.

The name of default database getting created at the time of installation is Orcl.
In Windows one service gets created for each database. The name of that service is OracleServiceORCL. It should be running.
For getting connected with external applications there is one service known as TNSListener. It also should be running.

Users in Oracle Database:
There are mainly 2 types of users.
1) DBA user
2) Non-DBA user

1) DBA user: Sys and System are the two database users by default getting created.
The password is to be set while installing.

2) Non-DBA user: They are created later by Sys or System user.
One user Scott with password tiger will be created.

Database -- User  -- Table Relationship in Oracle:

Orcl -- Database
	Scott -- User or also known as Schema
		Emp is the table

The Physical data file in which actually the data is stored has extension .dbf.
It is binary file.

Entire C drive has 2 TB space
Out of which for Oracle 700 GB is allocated.

For the user Scott we need to allocate some space within that 700 GB.

So, tablespace needs to be mapped with the user.

Tablespace is collection of one or multiple data files (.dbf).
Users is the name of default Tablespace.
It is having the default datafile Users01.dbf

Scott user has to be mapped to Users Tablespace.
